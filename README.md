## Introduction

Because of the huge cost of computational resources and the processing time needed, numerous problems such as cryptology, many body quantum mechanics, and quantum machine learning still can't be solved effectively even utilizing the most powerful supercomputers today. However, quantum computers, which are based on the quantum mechanics, have demonstrated huge advantages in these fields by benefiting from the advanced quantum algorithms. Among those quantum algorithms, the Shor large number decomposition algorithm as well as the Grover quantum search algorithm are the two most renowned. They have raised interest from the scientists and is inspiring further development of quantum computing and quantum information. Unfortunately, the development curve of the quantum computer hardware is still not very step, and there is no actual quantum computer which can be used for solving practical science or cryptology issues. Thus, the quantum systems are still simulated by using the classical computers.

QuEST is a new simulator of universal quantum circuits. QuEST is capable of simulating generic quantum circuits of general one-qubit and two-qubits and multi-qubit controlled gates, on pure and mixed states, represented as state-vectors and density matrices under the presence of decoherence.

Describing the state of an n-bit classical register requires just n bits while describing the state of an n-qubit quantum register requires 2^n complex numbers. As a result, simulating a quantum computer using a classical machine is believed to be exponentially expensive with respect to the number of qubits. But despite this, classical simulation of quantum computation is crucial for the study of new algorithms and architectures.
